# Organize Photos
* Very simple effective program to organize photos in a folder by date order
* It has simple gui support
* It takes the oldest date of a file (creation date, change date, modifying date, original date of photo etc.)
* Renames file name with oldest date
* Keeps the old filename in case the date is wrong
* Groups photos by year and month

```
original filename = 12212020.jpg
oldest date of photo = 13.07.2015
new filename = 13Temmuz2015-12212020.jpg
new file path = 2015/07-Temmuz-2015/13Temmuz2015-12212020.jpg
```
